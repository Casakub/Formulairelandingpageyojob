    title: "Your questions about secondment",
    items: [
      {
        question: "Who is the employer of the posted worker?",
        answer: "The posted worker remains employed by the temporary employment agency (TEA) in their home country. The TEA is their legal employer, who pays them, manages their social security contributions and remains their HR contact. You are the user company that hosts the worker on your site."
      },
      {
        question: "How are accommodation and transport managed?",
        answer: "YOJOB coordinates with the partner agency to organize complete round-trip transport (plane, bus, carpooling depending on distance). For accommodation, we can connect you with our local partners (hotels, residences, apartments) or the agency can manage directly according to your preferences."
      },
      {
        question: "What's the difference between European temporary work and secondment?",
        answer: "It's the same thing! Secondment refers to when a worker employed in country A comes to work temporarily in country B while remaining affiliated with country A's social security system. European temporary work is a type of secondment where the employer is a temporary employment agency."
      },
      {
        question: "What costs should the user company expect?",
        answer: "You receive an invoice from the agency that includes: the worker's gross salary according to the applicable collective agreement in France, social security charges, the agency's management fees, and possibly transport/accommodation costs according to the agreement. YOJOB provides you with a transparent quote detailing all these costs before any signature."
      },
      {
        question: "What happens if there's a problem during the assignment?",
        answer: "YOJOB remains your privileged contact throughout the assignment. In case of difficulty (absence, language problem, non-compliance), we immediately contact the partner agency to find a solution: worker replacement, mediation, job adaptation, etc. Our role is to ensure the continuity of your business."
