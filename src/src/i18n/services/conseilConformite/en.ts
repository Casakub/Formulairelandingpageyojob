    items: [
      {
        question: "What is the A1 form and who must provide it?",
        answer: "The A1 form (formerly E101) is the certificate attesting that the posted worker remains affiliated to the social security system of their country of origin. It is the temporary employment agency (TEA) of the country of origin that must request it from their social security organization and provide it."
      },
      {
        question: "What are the obligations of the host company in case of posting?",
        answer: "The host company must: verify that the TEA has made the SIPSI declaration, ensure the presence of the A1 form, apply French working conditions (minimum wage, working time, rest), keep mandatory documents available, and designate a representative in case of inspection."
      },
      {
        question: "How to declare a posted worker on SIPSI?",
        answer: "It is the foreign TEA (or its representative in France) that must make the prior declaration of posting on the SIPSI platform (sipsi.travail.gouv.fr) before the start of the assignment. This declaration must be made at least within a reasonable time before posting. YOJOB helps you verify that this formality has been completed."
      },
      {
        question: "What are the risks in case of non-compliance?",
        answer: "The risks are significant: administrative fine up to €4,000 per worker (€8,000 in case of recidivism), reclassification as undeclared work, financial solidarity of the host company in case of non-payment of wages/contributions, and possible suspension of activity. Hence the importance of expert support."
      },
      {
        question: "Are the regulations the same in all European countries?",
        answer: "No, each country has its own regulations to govern the posting of workers on its territory. The European Directive 2018/957 sets a common framework, but each Member State has transposed it differently. This is why our expertise in all 27 countries is essential to guarantee your compliance."
